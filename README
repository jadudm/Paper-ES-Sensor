Paper ES Sensor
===============

The goal of this project was to quickly design and build an affordable sensor that could measure and log light and temperature, both on a fixed schedule as well as when motion was detected in a room. The physical design follows from the Cardboarduino, in that it involves a "motherbaord" on cardboard. All the critical functional unites are then plugged into female headers. This way, the majority of the sensor can be reused/repurposed for other designs.

The sensor platform is based on the Atmega328p. It is written in occam-pi, and leverages the Plumbing libraries.
